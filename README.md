### Backend Systems Architect | Clean Architecture & AI Integration

Experienced backend systems architect specializing in clean architecture, universal data modeling, and AI system integration. I design and implement maintainable, scalable backend systems with a focus on proper domain modeling and clean code principles.

## Core Focus Areas
- Backend system architecture & design
- RAG/LLM system integration
- Universal data modeling (Silverston patterns)
- Clean architecture principles (SOLID)
- Object-oriented design

## Notable Projects

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design
- [core](https://github.com/jessehogan/core) - Enterprise-grade backend framework implementing universal data modeling patterns
- [phpbo](https://github.com/jessehogan/phpbo) - PHP ORM based on clean architecture principles
- [transient-entities](https://github.com/jessehogan/transient-entities) - TypeScript library for robust collection management

### 📊 Data & Analysis
- [analysis](https://github.com/jessehogan/analysis) - Python framework for financial analysis and modeling

## Technical Background
```python
domains = {
    'architecture': ['clean architecture', 'domain-driven design', 'SOLID principles'],
    'ai_integration': ['RAG systems', 'LLM integration', 'vector databases'],
    'backend': ['Python', 'PHP/Laravel', 'TypeScript'],
    'databases': ['MySQL', 'vector stores', 'ORM design'],
    'patterns': ['universal data modeling', 'object-oriented design', 'business objects']
}
```

## Current Focus
Building maintainable, scalable backend systems with integrated AI capabilities, focusing on clean architecture and proper domain modeling. Particularly interested in implementing RAG systems and LLM integration patterns while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.

## Philosophy
> "The best architectures emerge from a deep understanding of business domains combined with clean design principles and proper data modeling."
