### Backend Systems Architect | Clean Architecture & AI Integration

Experienced backend systems architect specializing in clean architecture, universal data modeling, and AI system integration. I design and implement maintainable, scalable backend systems with a focus on proper domain modeling and clean code principles.

## Core Focus Areas
- Backend system architecture & design
- RAG/LLM system integration
- Universal data modeling (Silverston patterns)
- Clean architecture principles (SOLID)
- Object-oriented design

## Notable Projects

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design
- [core](https://github.com/jhogan/core) - Enterprise-grade backend framework implementing universal data modeling patterns
- [phpbo](https://github.com/jhogan/phpbo) - PHP ORM based on clean architecture principles
- [transient-entities](https://github.com/jhogan/transient-entities) - TypeScript library for robust collection management

### 📊 Data & Analysis
